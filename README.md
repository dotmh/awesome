  * [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) - My favourite design tool for UI and UX
  * [Warp](https://warp.dev/) - The best Terminal emulator for the Mac

## :man_technologist: My Stack

This is the default stack that I use for most projects. I find it very productive and easy to work with.
This isn&#x27;t the only stack that I use, but it&#x27;s the one that I use most often.


  * [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - My favourite programming language
